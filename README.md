# rest-api
A simple user-management REST API. Made in Python using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL.

In order to run the application you may:
- Have Postgres configured on the local machine
- Install the specified dependencies from requirements.txt (pip install -r requirements.txt)
- Open a terminal in the project's folder and run "uvicorn main:app"

** During development, I used to check the app's usability by sending client requests to the API using Insomnia.
